# PythonInts
Unlike traditional languages, python offers infinite precision ints by storing them as lists of 30 bit blocks. This is a small project that shows the largest possible int of a list of every size up to MAX_LEN. There are options for how this number is represented and relies on a dependency I wrote, sayFullName.
